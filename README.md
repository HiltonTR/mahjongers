# Anywhere by Mahjongers
HackED 2022 project

# Inspiration
Where do you wanna eat? Anywhere.
Ok but like WHERE though???
The Anywhere App will help users to find local restaurants that they will enjoy!
During covid we had a lot of take out and determining where to eat was a pain because we're all indecisive!

# What it does
Recommend Restaurants based on the user's mood and location

# How we built it
Using Python for backend and HTML,CSS and JS for frontend. Used the Yelp API to find the top searches for restaurants then looked a Google Reviews to find restaurant environments.

# Challenges we ran into
Connecting the front end to the back end. Merge conflicts on GitHub

# What we learned
Flask and Git

# What's next for mahjongers
QOL changes. Hoping to add pictures of the food and possibly a way to order food

# How to use:
1) Make sure that all the dependencies are installed from requirement.txt

# To Run:
clone this repository
cd into the repository
to start up the flask server
    (on windows): $env:FLASK_APP = "server" followed by flask run
    (on mac): FLASK_APP = server flask run
navvigate over to the server started by flask and enter all the required parameters and hit begin and see for yourself!
