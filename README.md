# Anywhere by Mahjongers
HackED 2022 project

# Inspiration
Where do you wanna eat? Anywhere.
Ok but like WHERE though???
The Anywhere App will help users to find local restaurants that they will enjoy!

# What it does
Recommend Restaurants based on the user's mood and location

# How we built it
Using Python for backend and HTML,CSS and JS for frontend. Used the Yelp API to find the top searches for restaurants then looked a Google Reviews to find restaurant environments.

# Challenges we ran into
Connecting the front end to the back end. Merge conflicts on GitHub

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The code runs (barely)

# What we learned
Flask and GitHub

# What's next for mahjongers
QOL changes. Hoping to add pictures of the food and possibly a way to order food
