I love this place. Best all you can eat sushi in Edmonton! They also have some great vegan options! Service is fast and friendly!
All you can eat menu $35 pp. Fast service, clean restaurant. All the food was ok
Overall, the food was okay. Most of these "all you can eat sushi" are essentially the same However the reason I keep coming back is the service. Did I feel valued as a customer? Did they want me to be there? Was our table being attended too? Honestly no.Service wasn't great. The non verbal communication language appeared to be more annoyed that we kept ordering and asking for water, instead of encouraging us to enjoy and wanting us to come back. üòë
The sushi is delicious and they have all the flavors I could think of. The servers were great and kept the food coming to the table perfectly. Portions are not any problem as it is all you can eat; when you are full you simply stop eating. A very satisfying experience. If you love sushi and Japanese Cuisine this is the place.
All you can eat for $36/person. My overall experience was decent, hence the 3 star rating. Sashimi and hot food (e.g., tempura) were good for a buffet. Those two types of items were the best. Too much rice in the hand rolls. Also, what are you thinking with the fruity sushi rolls? I had to try it because it was so confusing but it was watermelon sushi. Please take it off the menu.
The staff were very friendly and fast, I'd rate them 10 stars if I could. The food is another story, Its decent? Definitely not great and the sashimi was the best part but the Maki rolls and sushi we received were soggy and tasted a bit strange. Overall the atmosphere and the staff were amazing, just wish the food could be a bit better.
Good place with good food, but only 20 pics Sashimi per person.
If you enjoy good quality sushi trust me DO NOT EAT HERE. This is the WORST sushi I have ever eaten. Mikado south common is the best sushi in Edmonton.
Hands down the best all you can eat Japanese cuisine in Edmonton. This is a go-to place for date nights. The atmosphere is cozy and upbeat with a great music selection and sectioned off booths. The owner is friendly and attentive, and the staff always do a great job! If you haven't eaten here before, what are you waiting for!
I was fasting for 22 hours and in the downtown area visiting. I was craving sashimi 50 minutes before closing. The staff was super accommodating & happy to serve me, they just made it clear that they were closing today at 9pm, which was much appreciated. The all you can eat is only $35 INCLUDING GST. I ordered the given amount of sashimi which is 20 pieces. That alone makes the trip here worth while. I also had miso soup, seaweed salad, golden basa, shrimp tempera, chop chop cone, tofu. This is just the tip of what they have on their extensive menu. THE VALUE IS 100% THERE AND WORTH HAVING IN YOUR ROTATION WEEKLY. Fish is the best source to keep your brain health at its optimal! If you're on a keto diet... this is awesome! To be honest, regardless of what your eating habit is... this is a MUST. :D
Great all you can eat sushi! Didn't like that the server touched the water jug to the cups when pouring water as it doesn't seem very sanitary
First time trying Watari. We loved the concept of all you can eat small portions. The food was absolutely delicious everything we order tasted great and was fresh. The service was fast and the staff friendly. It's definitely worth trying.
One of the best sushi places in the city. Worth every penny. 33$ dinner buffer on weekdays. Love their appetizers. I tried almost all of their appetizers and I‚Äôll give them 10/10 however regular sushi rolls were average. Overall 10/10. One extra star for their service. üëçüèº well done. Will recommend this place to all my friends.
Great foods and great service ,Friendly staff. We have our staff party there for past 3 years! Keep up a great work. Thanks
This has been one of me and my family's favourite all you can eat sushi establishments for a few years now since we found it!Every dish is delicious and the service is excellent.  Highly recommend!
Everything is tasteless, they put lots of rice into sushi and handcone to feed you, rice is also hard and dry. The quality of the fish is not good either.
Watari has the best prices in town and they are always super friendly and the owner will have a shot with you on your birthday, great atmosphere for sushi it feels like a little piece of Japan when it's -40 outside.
The food here is great and is resonably priced. The staff is friendly and are willing to help
Fast service and the maki rolls are delicious
Favourite place to get all you can eat sushi in edmonton, my girlfriend and I come here weekly! Owner is always there making sure service is great!Highly recommend their golden Canadian and golden California rolls!Also the washrooms are well kept and have always smelled clean (like chemicals).
Had a greattttttt experience at this restaurant especially because of the owner! Such a hardworking boss, he made sure my boyfriend and I tried the best food on the menu, helped us with our drink orders nd consistently checked in on us. His customer service was out of this world plus the food IS DELICIOUS! Don't look any further come eat here.
Best all you can eat sushi in Edmonton. Friendly staff, great service, quality food.
First time having "all you can eat" at Watari. Rave review ahead!The service was excellent from start to finish. Lots of servers buzzing about and clearing plates as we finished things. Plates were brought quick, not like some places that try and limit how much you order by being purposefully slow. Time limit of 1.5 hours to place orders is SUPER generous considering how fast they were. They warn there is a charge if you over order and want to take home leftovers. Don't know how much that charge is. Ask b4 order if your party is prone to eyes being bigger than stomach.The dishes were not just standard things you find, but many creative dishes not seen on an average "all you can eat" menu. Which is very nice to see. Tempura dishes we had were all perfect. More veggie/vegan options than average sushi place. The fruit salad roll was super bright and refreshing and our surprise favourite of the night. And if you have not tried spam sushi, don't knock it until you have tried it.I hadn't had it in years. A friend who is a chef used to make a maki with spam in Fort McMurray, but this the first time I've seen it on a menu. Sorry Watari, not as good as my friend's, but still tasty.We're glad we went early when they opened because it didn't take long until the place was packed. (a pack of people came in wearing Oilers jerseys, so bad on us for not checking game schedule lol)Watari is well worth the 35 per head plus drinks. Only complaint would be the chicken karage was a bit overdone, but that's so minor considering how busy it was.
We came here for our celebration/mourning of our dad who had passed away December 6th of 2018. I am really happy I decided to come here this is the 3rd all you can eat sushi place we have been and this is definitely my new favorite place! The food was fantastic the staff were amazing! They were super busy when we arrived so our first round of food took awhile but once the kitchen caught up we had food after food coming. The owner bought or table a round of sake bombs and was a real nice guy too! If you are looking for a sushi place with a friendly atmosphere I definitely recommend coming here they have more then just sushi too and over 100 items to choose from. I can not wait for our next visit it's now the go to place for our sushi needs! Thank you Watari staff for a fun night.
All you can eat sushi .... Fast service loved it
We came as a group of 5 around the start of dinner and there was no wait for seating. Sushi was good and all their kitchen food was good as well. Unfortunately they kept bringing us deep fried food we didn't order. Our orders were purposefully small as well in hopes they would not miss any items we ordered but they still missed a few items. The biggest issue I had was that 45 minutes in they told us it was last call for our table which is unexpected as we are allotted 90 minutes to order. We ordered as normal and it was clear that this was just a tactic to get us to stop ordering. There is also a mandatory 18% gratuity which was fine as we would have tipped that much regardless but the menu states that parties 6 more will be charged this and we were only 5. Overall really good sushi and food but a poor customer experience for multiple reasons highlighted above.
Great sushi spot downtown. Great portion sizes and thick cut sashimi.
Great experience and food was awesome. Definitely worth the cost.
The service here was impeccable. We waited for quite awhile to get a table, but once we did our food was lightening fast. All the staff kept checking on us to make sure we were happy. Sashimi, tempura, rolls, miso soup, all of it was delicious! Best of all i got to try the Japanese cheesecake since it was my birthday and it was so light and flavourful. Thank you!
service 1 star.Food is not good compared to before.pretty much I won't come back again.I think one of reason because the owner wasn't in the shop.
TLDR: 4/5 for all you can eat. Best items are sashimi  and hot items.  Don't order the rolls.Details:Sashimi salmon piece sizes are on the small side, but high quality.I'd say to avoid the rolls entirely.I just got takeout for the first time and the rolls were basically 98 percent rice.The avocado salmon roll is the best one and it is only ok. The quality of the fish is amazing but it's a crazy amount of rice.The avocado roll has such a razor thin layer of avocado it's miraculous they were able to shave it so thin and get it on in one piece.So disappointed in the rolls tonight given the price for what was essentially just rice. Been struggling to find an Edmonton place with amazing rolls like Takumi sushi in Calgary.
Great atmosphere! Great little spot. The owner is amazing, always checking in on everyone and even gave us extra sashimi when we already were maxed out. Will be back again!!!!
Worst Sushi I have ever eaten! Staff were friendly and asked why we did not eat our food, so we told them how bad it was.  They seemed concerned but offered no remedy.  Very limited menu and food was definitely not fresh as Sushi SHOULD be. They did manage to get the bill right and charged us the full cost. Nearly $100.00 down the drain.
Great service and great food! With AYCE sushi you generally always expect a wait, but they are super fast here, price is great, and portion is good too! Would definitely recommend coming here!
Always good food, friendly servers too! $30pp includes 20 pieces of sashimi each and a great all u can eat menu. Been there many times now, almost every time I come back to Edmonton, we go!
Amazing service and food. The kindest staff!
If you're in the booths (specifically the first one by the door) expect not to get served. We accidentally spilled some green tea and waited 45 minutes for anyone to come. They have buttons for service, that worked when we got there, but apparently it was "broken" after we brought up how long we had been waiting. Not to mention, the sushi was very bland and the rice was either under-cooked or old. Not our usual experience here in terms of quality. Service and food was just so bad this particular time we came, so definitely not a very consistent experience.
Pretty good for AYCE, service was friendly and attentive, we got our food quick and seemed fresh. Personally wasn't a fan of the Canadian roll (too big, greasy texture) but obviously tastes are individual! Decor seemed dark and a bit dated, but the booth set up is perfect for separation during covid times.
The staff are told to ask customers for the online proof of Alberta Covid Record. I had the scan of the printed of the confirmation of both doses from Shoppers. But they didn't accept it. Requiring such online proof is ok with me, but what is not acceptable is on their website they have put Zero Information that they need the "new" version of the Covid proof. Here I attach the screenshot of what is mentioned on the website. I asked the staff/server to talked with her manager but she didn't let her manager know, instead she was again asking for the online Covid Record. Maybe there was an English barrier that she couldn't understand what I asked from her? Maybe yes, maybe not!Eventually, I was able to get the online Covid Proof after several attempts and could put an order afterwards. But it was not nice to have such a surprise when I went to a restaurant to have a little bit of a good time. I would assume somebody would be in charge of Watari's website and update what they would require the customers to bring along. Apparently, no body is in charge of that.The food quality to my opinion was not as good as it used to be. If I remember correctly it used to be busier and more people used to visit Watari. So lower food quality could be due to less support from the locals. It might be a little hard to judge. Which was first? Chicken or egg?!Anyway, I hope they won't give more surprises to other customers.
Always fresh, delicious, and generous.Staff is helpful and quick.Skip lunch before going here for dinner!
I generally love watari, great food and people.The atmosphere is a little hectic with their music choice for it being a little classier. I got food poisoning from their mussel sashimi so I didn‚Äôt go for a while. But I visited it last week again, no food poisoning and tasted great
Such a great time every time!We love taking friends there. It's great to all be paying the same price and get you eat whatever YOU like. It's a hit!
Nice staff. Sushi & Sashimi are not super good. Sushi rice is cold and not tasty.
Food was great, The Tuna Sushi and Tempura Mushrooms were my fav when I got the All You Can Eat.
Best sushi in the city. At least I think so.
Seriously the best sushi in Edmonton! Amazing prices for the amount and variety of food you can get! Have been going here for a couple years now, really love it!  The owner is also super friendly and always super welcoming! Won't go anywhere else for sushi except here!
Really enjoy going for Sushi at Watari. Staff are friendly and the sushi is fresh!
Great place for tsushi. Also love the karage chicken, and teriyaki beef and chicken.
I was here 10 months ago on a Sunday midday, and came back a second time yesterday evening (Saturday) for dinner. I would say that timing is everything with this place. Originally I rated it a 4, and as you can see, now it's a 3.Although the restaurant was packed, the wait time wasn't too bad. 15 minutes at most for the three of us. A fairly reasonable wait.I remembered how delicious the food was, how warm and freshly made most of the items were and how happy I was with my first experience here. I raved to every I knew! Sadly this time, I must say it's one star less on a Saturday night. During the busiest times, they don't give you the luxury of having warm food. It seems their strategy is quantity over quality. For example, as soon as we finished filling out our order, those 12 tacos were on our table within 5 minutes! Again, the restaurant was PACKED. I was shocked at the speed, and then immediately disappointed to find they were fairly cold. Mustve been a popular choice and Watari reacted with batch cooking.That didn't mean that it wasn't good, but it definitely took away from my past experience and didn't serve justice for my brother, who I brought with me as a first-timer. Him and I tend to brag to each other about finding new places to eat and activities to try, so that was really crappy for me... Lol.Anyway, keep at it Watari. I'm on your side. I would definitely come back, but probably only on a Sunday.TIP: If you find yourselves having to wait for a table, make sure to ask the server for a sheet so you can prefill your order form! The food will come out even faster!
A fantastic, all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that also does take out. I've been to many in the city but none of them hold a candle to the consistent quality Watari brings. The food always tastes great each time we visit and the service is exceptionally fast. I couldn't recommend any further than to try this place out. It might become your favourite too!
