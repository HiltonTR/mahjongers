Sub par at best. Do not waste your money. I came here for a classy dinner for our last night visiting atlanta and we didnt feel like as much of an obligation as their patrons of another color if you know what I mean.Beautiful inside but deeply discriminatory. If a white customer has an issue they resolve and move on. If a black customer has an issue , its seen as annoying.
Great drinks. We went earlier and really enjoyed ourselves. We’ve been several times.
This was my first Speakeasy and I had a great time! I went for my best friend's bday (it was 11 of us in total) and we had a ball. The service was superb and the drinks were great! I also enjoyed the music, which was not too loud and played at the right decibels. This place is for a mature crowd. People were dressed well and friendly. I definitely  plan to go back for a date night. I hope someone can get me in again 🤞😊
Great drinks, amazing dessert, good atmosphere/music
A Japanese speakeasy? Yes, they really do exist. And they have a strict dress code. And you need a reservation. But don't let that deter you. The place is pretty pricy with each drink running about $20, but it's a great place to take a date. I think I tried almost every non-Gin based drink on the menu and each one was as good as the last. The desserts are also very good. For a special treat get the smoked Whiskey drink!
Went there for a birthday. Sent an email and got a code to get in the door. Drinks were good, vibe was fun. They try to maintain a certain level of dress code, which I totally appreciate. If people want to wear tennis shoes and sweatshirts, they need to go to Applebees, not an Asian inspired speakeasy. Would go again!
There is a reason it’s called a secret lounge, Himitzu, ATL. I would say they server the best cocktail in the city of Atlanta. We came here after having a great dinner at UMI.The place got some very positive vibes, music, the people who work here but above great cocktails. If you are in Atlanta this is a must-visit but before coming here make sure to make it to UMI for dinner and ask for the secret code to get into Himitzu. if you aee nice, you may get one :)Cheers,BN
The rock shrimp tempura was excellent
Very chic and fun private cocktail lounge ... If you can gain access, well worth the effort. Very solid and unique crafted cocktail menu
One of Buckhead's best-kept secrets. Love the dark, intimate setting and creative drinks.
The drinks are off the chain here. Great service as well.
This is might be my favorite exclusive lounge in the city.  If you have the opportunity to go here, it is a must.  The drinks are fantastic, and the atmosphere is very top-notch.  I love to stop by here either before or after I grab a bite to eat next door at UMI, which has the same ownership.  You can get some of the food at UMI served to you at Himitsu, but I recommend just having a reservation at both.  As for the drinks at Himitsu, I always forget the name of it, but here is a drink with Japanese whisky, a little sherry, and it is served in a smoky glass.  I inevitably get a little toasted every time I go there because of that drink.  Amazing.  Be sure to check this place out.
Sushi rice?  More like uncle Ben's minute rice. Take your money elsewhere.
Do not eat here or his other restaurant named UMI! This restaurant picks & chooses who the dress code applies to. There was a white woman wearing tennis shoes but yet a black man was turned away due to his tennis shoes. The owner had the chance to smooth things over & simply shrugged off the black mans concerns & didn’t even care to make sure the white woman was also removed for her tennis shoes.
The owner has trained his employees to discriminate against African Americans and is very unprofessional. The food is sub par so really not sure how they could even turn down customers. You couldn't pay me to eat here. Save your money and spend it where your business is appreciated and you arent looked at as just a $ sign.
It was a little difficult getting in, but I enjoyed myself once I gained entry. Cool vibes.
One of the worst experience of my life. Never ever met such a disrespectful staff and the food was really below average. Unbelievable. Don't waste your money there.
This was the place to end the night and start my next day. I threw a suprise party for my wife and the moment the staff found out they showed out. It was an impeccable evening when it came to service, atmosphere and drinks.
Nice place to slide in and get a drink in a comfortable private environment..
It was the worst food i've had in my entire öife so far!! Really disgusting so i couldt eat more then i had on my fork the first taste to it.. 🤮The staff had also a wery bad attitude towards me and my family, along with ceveral other customers close to our table. Really this was a bad experience!! Never again that place.Ciao

Delicious new addition for Chinese food with Sichuan flair.  Their signature dish of chicken pot was seasoned well, and essentially is two dishes as after you finish the chicken they will add additional meat balls and veggies.  Would recommend giving it a try.
This is the place I will recommend to everyone in Edmonton if they want to try delicious and fine Chinese food. 👍👍👍
好夠鑊氣。一定要預定乳鴿，好正，有沙田乳鴿味道。仲有雞煲同豉椒炒蜆，超正。The chef control the heat very well when cooking the food, so it brings out the full flavor of the food, in Cantonese we call it "wok hei". To be honest, it's very hard to find in Edmonton, just because of this, I gave 4 stars.Make sure you pre-order the Braised Pigeon, reminds me the well-known braised Pigeon in Hong Kong (Lung Hua Hotel, Shatin). It's very hard to keep the pigeon's skin crunchy and the meat moist, I guess that's why almost no other chinese restaurant in Edm offer this dish. Well done 👍🏼 Chicken King.We also ordered their customers favorite - Spicy Chicken Pot (comes with Korean glass noodles and beef balls), if you like spicy, this will be the dish you don't want to miss at Chicken King.Last but not least, we ordered the stir fry clam with black bean sauce. Even my 3 years old daughter love this dish.
Very high food quality. Excellent service. Deliveries always on time. Clean and comfortable. I definitely recommend and I would come again!
The Lemon chicken and ginger beef we had was very good, tasted fresh and was served hot.  Effective delivery service.  Highly recommend this place.
Nice fresh ingredients used in the traditionally western dishes we ordered.  Food was hot and delicious. Sweet and our is my favorite.
Ordered delivery from here last night. The veg chow mein was flavourless. Ginger beef was okay. Everything lacked flavour and needed salt - which is unusual for Chinese food. I wouldn't recommend this place unfortunately.
got a delivery order from Chicken King for Christmas lunch. Great food, so delicious~~  I will definitely order again!!
The traditional chicken pot is really good and worth a try.
Great place and lots of yummy dishes!!
Tasty food in sizeable quantity. Excellent customer service allowed us to change our Uber eats order without hesitation
Ordered Xams Dinner by skip the dishes  from this place . When food was not delivered for 2 hours ,  called the restaurant as they manage their deliveries  themselves. Phone number listed on their website was switched off. Skip the dishes called after few minutes and told me that restaurant is having some issues and can't deliver however restaurant was still accepting orders . Thanks for ruining our xmas dinner . Don't accept orders if you can't handle
Worst customer service ever.. Never order through skip the dishes with them, skip says the restaurant is responsible for delivery and never got my order delivered, called the restaurant and the owner doesn't even know my address but keep on saying deliver on the way after 2 hours.. Such a scam.. And never even apologised for leaving my 2 kids hungry.. Hope they learn some customer service
Love the place, love the food!!  Highly recommended!!
If ALL you want is JUST big hunks of broccoli in EVERY dish you order, then you have come to the right place! FEAST BROCCOLI LOVERS FEAST!
Have a surprise!!!taste good!!
This was my first time ordering from Chicken King -  and it definitely deserves a five start review. The food was absolutely terrific, the prices are very reasonable and the employees very friendly. The Singapore noodles were my favourite!Definitely making this my new go-to for Chinese cuisine. Highly recommend!
Ribs had little to no meat on them. Very low quality, all grizzle. Chicken curry was very bland, lot of veg though. Disappointing overall. Also took 1.5hrs to arrive.
The food tastes really good. My favorite chinese restaurant.
I ordered chicken pot and butter chicken.  Fast delivery service, food is delicious.
