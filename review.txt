We went to try the new drinks (The fertile Cresent, middle eastern inspired). As someone who makes a drinks Turkish coffee often I loved the idea, the execution though was unfortunately missed.The place looks amazing as usual, great music, perfect lighting, and the old fashioned was good.The service is usually okay at best, good at checking up on you and getting you seated but it lacks that connection that makes yoi want to come back, or specifically request someone. The fact they just put the cheese plate down and walked away (there are 4 different types of cheese, what kinds of cheese are they?) And the presentation..at least put some effort in? I wish I took a picture I was just so surprised by the lack of effort that I forgot to.That being said I would honestly rather go to other places on 104 or near by that have great service, food, and drinks.It is really a shame because I have been hearing so many good things about the place, might try again (This was my second visit)
Amazing experience and the servers were on top of everything. Food and drinks were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.
Amazing cocktails and a really cozy yet sleek vibe. It's great for a date night out!
Can't say enough positive about our experience, absolutely fantastic and quick service, very knowledgeable and friendly staff, great food and amazing drinks. We asked for suggestions on a drink and Steve the bartender gave us something he created which turned out super good. Highly recommend checking them out.
Great bar with a selection of unique and classic cocktails. The food is also delicious and their staff are super friendly! Hope to return soon!
This cocktail bar is a hit. Amazing cocktails, all well made with care. They also make cocktails not on the menu. The staff would make custome drinks based on what flavours we wanted at the time. Truly professional and a joy to dine here.  The dessert was also decadent.
Still the best cocktail bar in the city. House sour tastes just as good as it did 4 years ago. Just go.
Such great staff. Tasty cocktails and tapas. Love going here whenever I attend the theater. I finally returned here to enjoy indoor dinning with a couple of friends. Truly a delight. Staff is still amazing and asked the bartender to make us a couple cocktails that were not on the list and he totally rocked and the parameters we had set and served some very tasty drinks. Food was tasty and totally enjoyed the experience.
Woodwork is an excellent place to eat. The smell of the wood fire and the design of the restaurant make this place a unique visit and the food will have you coming back to try more. Good for a first date or to try an interesting cocktail, or three!
Sturgeon was slightly slimy and fishy. It really needed more time in the pan plus the squash was hard, which means it was also under cooked. The caviar was low quality and the buerre blanc tasted like mayonnaise. Worst restaurant. Also only got 3 pieces of fish that were like 1Ã—1 inch each. This all for $30 such a rip off.
Great atmosphere and all around experience. I would say the best place to go for drinks in the city. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and with the extensive liquor list (see picture) your options are limitless. If you can't decide, just tell the tender what you like and dislike and they will create something awesome. We usually like to go and sit at the bar for an app and a few drinks. Drinks and food are pricey but definitely worth in in my opinion. Staff are also friendly. Limited menu options, but everything on it is delicious. Highly recommend for a night out.
As soon as you step in. You noticed the smell of fire wood. It was a nice feeling. The service and food was good. I recommend making reservations before coming here. It can only seat so many.
Went with a friend for some small plates and drinks.The service was excellent as we were seated quickly and given enough time to see what's on the menu.The drinks that we got was excellent but was a bit disappointed with the food as I found it a bit bland and my friend agreed.  If I had to pick the brussel sprouts was my favorite followed by the fried chicken. The chicken was really tender and juicy inside. The beef tartar was ok...Will definitely come back again for more cocktails in the future.
Chill staff, cozy little place, good cocktails, saved to my list for future Edmonton visits!
Wonderful place to stop for quality food and exceptional cocktails. I order the full charcuterie board nearly everytime I'm there.
Awesome food, fantastic cocktails, incredibly knowledgeable and friendly staff. Amazing collection of rare spirits! Definitely one of the best cocktail bars in Edmonton.
My absolute favourite place for unique drinks and quick bites. I love the unique middle eastern infused drinks.
First time here and overall the experience was excellent! Food was absolutely amazing. My wife and I shared a charcuterie board with cheese, and I had the steak tartar. Both tasted fantastic! Only reason I'm giving 4 stars (and this might sound picky) is because our table was 6 feet away from the door and every time someone came in or left... Freezing wind hit us and the next 2 tables besides us.
Great fine dining experience, staff was really nice, food and drinks very tasty ðŸ’›
Portions are incredible for the price, most comfortable fine dining experience I've had!
