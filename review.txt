The nicest private room karaoke bar in Edmonton. Owned by the nicest people. With the nicest Korean snacks menu. And a nice Western tune selection too!
I've been to Soju before it was called Soju. It used to be the Hangover, and since then it has been renovated and changed ownership a few times.Soju as of today is freshly renovated with new decor and seating, and is probably one of the best karaoke places in Edmonton. The food is great and alcohol isn't too pricey. Huge song selection, but I wish that they'd have more recent songs. Would recommend!
The staff was friendly, the food was great the drink prices were reasonable. Room was clean and inviting. 10/10
It was really fun! Learning to use the machine was a bit confusing because it's written in Korean but the guy at the front helped us out. A lot of recent and old songs. They only take minors until 10:30pm. I also recommended you make reservations and 1 hour is definitely not enough time
❤️ Fried chicken  + ❤️ Soju + ❤️ Karaoke = best place in town!It does get quite busy on the weekends so I encourage you to book in advance.☠️☠️ To elevate your experience, ask for their soju + yakult mixed drink ☠️☠️
We tried the cheese and rosu katsu, they’re pretty good but serving is too little for a $17 bento.
This place is the bomb.com for Karoke. Clean, comfortable, and spacious rooms with kind staff. Only thing was everything but fries and I guess the chicken wings was not good. Menu sounds delicious but when we got the food... it was the total opposite.
Our go-to karaoke bar! Really enjoy the private rooms and the food they serve.
Server was pretty rude today; there was a misunderstanding on how we wanted to split the bill when we paid and we really didn't care (wanted to split food into 4 and karaoke room fee into 3); if it wasn't split right we would've just e-transferred each other but server/cashier was passively aggressively insisting on asking us where soju would go and room fee etc even after we tried to explain it. After it was finally solved she swore in korean under her breath because she thought we would'nt hear.Just felt really bad because we were out to celebrate a birthday
Are server dropped hot soup on my partners lap! they didn't do anything besides say sorry and to top it off my baby octopus was over cooked. Hands down the worst place Ive been to that isn't fast food.
Their bulgogi fries and fried chicken is amazing.
Owner changed recently. Same karaoke but the food quality/amount just went through the floor (while being more expensive). No more side dishes, no more rice when ordering stew. Sad to see overly gentrified Korean food
Come for the karaoke and maybe a few of their appetizers.The actual entrée food menu is incredibly sub-par and pricing is higher than usual.Also cheese buldak sauce is the same as samyang hot sauce.This place had amazing katsu in the past, though it seems everything has changed.
Great selection of songs, and food is amazing as well.
Great food, great staff, song selection is a bit dated though
Thet have really good foods to drink!Also, couse they have a karaoke in it, I don't have to worry about moving after drinks..
Great sounding karaoke room and large collection of songs. Food and drinks were a little expensive for what it was but were served to us late into the night (past 10) and paired with yogurt soju, food was pretty good! Good menu and kind of relaxing
Very worth and great experiance
Ordered 2 $15 bowl of noodles from this restaurant, got 50 cent ichiban hard noodles and a hotdog? Called them and they denied it was from them??? YIKES
Service was unsatisfactory. No wines and a high uncorking fee. Food was decent. Drinks are expensive. They kick you out with a max 3 hours even when making reservations weeks before (also mentioning an extra hour would be appreciated at time of booking). List of music was great but took time to figure out the machine/remote. 4 mics were cool that more people can participate. We also had the biggest room and it was nice. It is also clean. I don't think I would go again due to the limitations of menu and service.
