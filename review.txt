Delicious new addition for Chinese food with Sichuan flair.  Their signature dish of chicken pot was seasoned well, and essentially is two dishes as after you finish the chicken they will add additional meat balls and veggies.  Would recommend giving it a try.
This is the place I will recommend to everyone in Edmonton if they want to try delicious and fine Chinese food. 👍👍👍
好夠鑊氣。一定要預定乳鴿，好正，有沙田乳鴿味道。仲有雞煲同豉椒炒蜆，超正。The chef control the heat very well when cooking the food, so it brings out the full flavor of the food, in Cantonese we call it "wok hei". To be honest, it's very hard to find in Edmonton, just because of this, I gave 4 stars.Make sure you pre-order the Braised Pigeon, reminds me the well-known braised Pigeon in Hong Kong (Lung Hua Hotel, Shatin). It's very hard to keep the pigeon's skin crunchy and the meat moist, I guess that's why almost no other chinese restaurant in Edm offer this dish. Well done 👍🏼 Chicken King.We also ordered their customers favorite - Spicy Chicken Pot (comes with Korean glass noodles and beef balls), if you like spicy, this will be the dish you don't want to miss at Chicken King.Last but not least, we ordered the stir fry clam with black bean sauce. Even my 3 years old daughter love this dish.
Very high food quality. Excellent service. Deliveries always on time. Clean and comfortable. I definitely recommend and I would come again!
The Lemon chicken and ginger beef we had was very good, tasted fresh and was served hot.  Effective delivery service.  Highly recommend this place.
Nice fresh ingredients used in the traditionally western dishes we ordered.  Food was hot and delicious. Sweet and our is my favorite.
Ordered delivery from here last night. The veg chow mein was flavourless. Ginger beef was okay. Everything lacked flavour and needed salt - which is unusual for Chinese food. I wouldn't recommend this place unfortunately.
got a delivery order from Chicken King for Christmas lunch. Great food, so delicious~~  I will definitely order again!!
The traditional chicken pot is really good and worth a try.
Great place and lots of yummy dishes!!
Tasty food in sizeable quantity. Excellent customer service allowed us to change our Uber eats order without hesitation
Ordered Xams Dinner by skip the dishes  from this place . When food was not delivered for 2 hours ,  called the restaurant as they manage their deliveries  themselves. Phone number listed on their website was switched off. Skip the dishes called after few minutes and told me that restaurant is having some issues and can't deliver however restaurant was still accepting orders . Thanks for ruining our xmas dinner . Don't accept orders if you can't handle
Worst customer service ever.. Never order through skip the dishes with them, skip says the restaurant is responsible for delivery and never got my order delivered, called the restaurant and the owner doesn't even know my address but keep on saying deliver on the way after 2 hours.. Such a scam.. And never even apologised for leaving my 2 kids hungry.. Hope they learn some customer service
Love the place, love the food!!  Highly recommended!!
If ALL you want is JUST big hunks of broccoli in EVERY dish you order, then you have come to the right place! FEAST BROCCOLI LOVERS FEAST!
Have a surprise!!!taste good!!
This was my first time ordering from Chicken King -  and it definitely deserves a five start review. The food was absolutely terrific, the prices are very reasonable and the employees very friendly. The Singapore noodles were my favourite!Definitely making this my new go-to for Chinese cuisine. Highly recommend!
Ribs had little to no meat on them. Very low quality, all grizzle. Chicken curry was very bland, lot of veg though. Disappointing overall. Also took 1.5hrs to arrive.
The food tastes really good. My favorite chinese restaurant.
I ordered chicken pot and butter chicken.  Fast delivery service, food is delicious.
